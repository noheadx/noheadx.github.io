_I know it's hard - being a leader is..._ that's one of my most memorable movie quotes because that's how people used to look at leadership: it's exhausting, painful, comes with a price, you're lonely up there yaddiyaddi...

No! It doesn't need to be hard, exhausting or painful and your definitely not a good leader if you're all alone. It's just one of the things that are necessary to make companies successful. I write about all the things that I think are necessary to make a company successful in this blog - just sharing my views.
