title: How I imagine my ideal workplace - Pt. 1 
layout: post

There are many ways to start a blog. Either writing something very smart and reflected about agile work or rather start with an article about the newest technology trends? Well, maybe later... maybe I need some time to figure out, what kind of blog I want to write.

I decided to start with some insights into how I think and what drove me to start this blog at all. 

As developers, we’re blessed with what we do. We earn money with what we’d be doing anyway. I have never heard of a surgeon coming home and doing a kidney transplantation after dinner just because someone asked him to. As developers, we do come home and set up a website on AWS including CI/CD for our neighbor because we like doing that! It’s what we always did. 

I started working with computers when I hacked my AD&D or Ultima save games in order to make my party of heroes invincible or even to translate the game into German. With more or less success - but I loved it! 
And this feeling is still the most important part of my work life - I need to love what I’m doing! 

So, what it that makes a workplace lovable for me?
It’s definitely not the perks - I just need a fast WiFi-connection and you can place me on a box or somewhere on the floor. I’ll bring my own food. 

The things that attract me the most in a company are:
* The vision
* The mindset 
* The team
* The product
 
## The vision

As employees, we want to bring value to the company. We will be part of making decisions, creating strategies and roadmaps or implementing new features.

In order to do that, we need something that gives a common direction - like a northern star, something we can unite our efforts for - that is the vision.

I believe, that every one of us has a vision - deliberately or not - a vision for our own lives, how we want to live, what we want to become in life. 

Our visions keep us going, they make us getting up early in the morning to start that hour-long commute to work, staying up late to prepare your kid’s birthday party or working through the weekends to finish that app you always wanted to build. Without a vision - that’s my conviction - mankind will stop existing because there is nothing left worth living for.

Like a human being, a company also needs something that defines its own reason for existing, inspires it’s employees and gives them guidance in their daily work. 
Of course, any CEO will tell you, that his company has a vision - but it’s ok to admit, that there is no vision yet as long as people work hard on finding it.

A vision is larger than the company and its people. It’s something, people can look up to and say: Ok, today we’re far away from that, but at least I know where this company is heading. I want to ask myself every day, “Did I contribute today to the company’s vision?” and have a clear answer for myself.

It’s not a vision to say ”We want to become #3 in the local market for selling auto parts.”…that’s a goal. Something you achieve on your way to fulfilling your vision.  
When you’re using OKR (which I highly recommend), you could use this goal as an objective and set some key results in order to measure if you have reached this goal or not, e.g. sales rate, revenue or number of customers. 

A proper vision for the auto parts selling company could be “When our customers think of auto parts, they will think of us - anytime, anywhere.” That’s an unmeasurable statement, yet it articulates an idea everyone in the company understands - no matter if those persons work in accounting, sales or development. 

There is another thing about visions: they can be interpreted differently, and I even claim, that they *must* be interpreted differently. My way of contributing to a company's vision is not necessarily the way my colleagues contribute to it. But still, it gives us an idea of how we can help and support the success of the company. 

Because of its ubiquitous character, a vision is not a policy nor is it a rule or an instruction of what to do - it’s just that divine spark to start the fire. It’s the job of each and every employee to keep the flame burning by transforming the vision into something that can actually be done - and the job of the management to remind people of that from time to time.

What happens if a company lacks a vision, is that people will start asking themselves, “What are we doing this for?”, they will either leave or start creating separate visions of their own - which are no longer commonly shared but are driven by individuals in a company, that could tear a company apart. 

That’s a scenario I have often seen in startups, where the initial management team has been replaced by the investors. The new CEO/COO/MD might know a lot more about business models, revenue streams and sales. But they often miss starting their job with either absorbing the vision from their predecessors or creating a vision of their own, causing the company to defocus or being torn up in too many different projects - with bankruptcy as the final end.

I don’t want that - I want to work in a company that either has a vision or is trying to create one, so I can contribute to that!
