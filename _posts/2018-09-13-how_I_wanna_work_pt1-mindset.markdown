# How I imagine my ideal workplace - Pt. 2

*_TL;DR_* A company’s mindset is defined by the way people work together, how they communicate and their view on their work / product. An attractive mindset for me would be that people follow the Agile Manifesto in their daily, have a honest, open and same-level kind of communication and they are proud of the product, their work and the company they are working for.

”Please describe your ideal workplace” is a typical question in a job interview. 
Even though it seems like a standard question to check if the candidate would be a match, the actual intent of this question is to see if the candidate has a clear opinion on his working environment and is able to articulate that.
So, whenever I’m hiring for a dev/devops/it position, this question will eventually popup at one point or another during the process.

As a person from the outside, you might think _Why would a developer need to reflect on his workplace anyway? After all, a developer will spent most his time in from of monitor, coding stuff…_

That might be - and probably is - true but when a person reflects on his ideal workplace and can name a couple of criteria that are important to him, it shows, that this persons brings a certain mindset, that he cares about the company and the culture he’s going to spend most of his daytime in.
Which brings me to my 2nd criteria for my ideal workplace…

## The mindset 
_hire the mindset and train the skills_ is a commonly used phrase, describing that if people only bring the right attitude to the job, you can train them all the rest and your company will prosper and earn billions of dollars - or so people think.

I am going to focus on hiring and teambuilding later in this blog, so let's take a look at this mindset-thing: what is it, what's it good for and why is the mindset of a company important to me?

Let's take a look at a definition of ”mindset”:
*A mindset is the attitude [of a person] towards life in general.*  
For a company this definition can be changed to 
*A mindset is the attitude of a company towards being successful in general.*

This attitude covers the 3 areas:
* How do people work in that company?
* How do people in the company interact with each other?
* How do people in the company look at the product?

### How do people work in that company?
This bullet point relates to the actual process of the daily work. The most important virtue in my daily work is the Agile Manifesto (a.k.a. common sense as I like to point out):

<p align="center">
Individuals and interactions <b>over</b> processes and tools<br/>
Working software <b>over</b> comprehensive documentation<br/>
Customer collaboration <b>over</b> contract negotiation<br/>
Responding to change <b>over</b> following a plan<br/>
<p>

The Manifesto explicitly mentions the things on the right because they are important and have every right to exist in a company or a team. It’s just, that the things on the left should be valued higher when it comes to work.
* _Individuals and interactions over processes and tools_ - let’s talk about a new requirement before hacking it into JIRA and giving everyone a headache because no-one understands it
* _Working software over comprehensive documentation_ - when it comes down to a deadline, let’s focus on deliver a working artefact rather than a fully documented but unfinished piece of software
* _Customer collaboration over contract negotiation_ - have the customer involved deeply in the development process and not just deliver status emails or project plans, because that’s the only thing defined in the contract
* _Responding to change over following a plan_ - while it’s important to have a plan on what you want to do, nothing is as persistent as change. So, make sure you’re not sticking to a plan just for the sake of it, but when circumstances change, e.g. the market you were currently focussing on became irrelevant for your business, be ready to change the plan!

The Agile Manifesto gives a guideline for how developers, product, sales, support and all the other units in a company should work together. It doesn’t define a process, like Scrum, that companies have a hard time in adapting, usually ending up in creating a hybridical monster like Scrum-ban without even realising what Scrum and Kanban actually are and why they should co-exist instead of being mixed up. 
 
A process should always serve a purpose - solving a specific problem. Don’t ever try to establish the one and only process for every problem that arise. A truly agile company would be able to adapt its way of working to problems at hand. You won’t be able to solve tomorrow’s problems with the same process you used to become successful yesterday. 
The actual idea behind the Agile Manifesto was to establish a way of solving problems iteratively: identify a problem, think of a solution, implement the solution, deploy the solution, test the solution, evaluate the solution, learn.
Neither does it say: _You are allowed to think of a solution for only 90mins per week nor does it say, if your PO didn’t write a ticket, then it’s not a problem._

So, I value companies that have adapted the 4 virtues of the Agile Manifesto in their daily work - even if they don’t name it that.

### How do people in the company interact with each other
If I have learned one thing in my career so far, it’s that people want to be treated as the grown-up they are, this includes
* giving trust - something you’d give as well as receive as a credit and that pays out over time
* a humble and respectful communication - on eye level, always focusing on the actual subject without getting personal
* fast, open and honest feedback - in both directions up/down, in a matter of fact sense 

I am trusting people that they will find the right solutions, make the best decisions, do the right implementations or hold each other responsible for the success of the company. On the other hand, I would expect trust from these people that I would also do only what’s good for the company. This trust is the most basic requirement for working together - there is no team, no result and no success without trust.

There are many people out there who are better developers or better managers than I am or they know much more about the business. So, it’s only reasonable that I talk to my co-workers on eye-level, since I will always be able to learn from them as much as they could learn from me. And as the term “co-worker” implies: we are working *together* on a problem and will only solve it *together*. 
This includes, that we discuss without emotions with a clear focus on the subject at hand - how many innovative and helpful business ideas have been yelled down in a meeting because someone wasn’t able to discuss things on pure professional level?

Giving feedback is something that is still not a very common thing to do in German society. People - and I'm explicitly including me here - are still thinking, that giving negative feedback is kind of rude and giving positive feedback is at best patronising and at worst weakens your own position, because it’s like admitting: “You’re better than me”.
On the other hand, when we receive honest and open feedback, we tend to feel like someone dumped us, feeling like we’re doing a bad job or that we are a bad person, which makes us feel bad or even fear to loose our job.
But giving and receiving feedback is important - evolution and personal development depends on the feedback we’re receiving from our environment. It’s a question of how to give feedback, if it’s a safe surrounding, if the feedback is validated and if it's really honest.

### How do people in the company look at the product
This basically means: Are they proud of the product or not? Are they coming to work just for the money or do they jump out of their beds every morning eager to run to the office and start working?
If people don’t love their job, but rather see it as a duty or worse as some sort of punishment, it can cause a poisonous mindset inside the company. Those people might start talking behind back, spreading rumours and by that creating an atmosphere in which their co-workers feel uncomfortable. 
It may sound quite arrogant or unrealistic to expect that people always come to work when there are millions of people out there who are happy to have a job or need to take on multiple jobs in order to feed their families. Fair enough and Kudos to those people! 
On the other hand we are talking about a very special market - as software developers we are blessed to get paid for something we’d do anyways because we just love to code. And if people don’t want to code for their current company or that specific product, it’s ok as long as they go and look for something else then. There is no need to get engaged in company politics or talking behind people’s back. I would always expect that a software developer has chosen his profession and his workplace deliberately and come to work with a smile, because for the next 8 hours she will do, what she loves the most.

So, if I see that a company tries to follow the Agile Manifesto - however they call it -, that people communicate in an open, trustful and honest manner with each other and that they love their work - well, that’s what I call a great company mindset.
