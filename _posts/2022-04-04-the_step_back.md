Why you should consider taking a career move that might look like a step back
<!--excerpt-end-->
## The step back
I recently took on a new position. Looking at my CV, I happen to do that every 2-3 years for different reasons...but that's another post.
While I am writing this specific post is: after CTO'ing companies since 2015, I am taking on a role that some people might see as a step back.  \
I'll start as a Director of Engineering.  \
The quite obvious question is: why? For sure, it's not out of despair. The open positions for CTOs are vast; 10-20 companies alone have contacted me for a CTO role in the past months.  

* The first reason is that I don't believe in the titles as motivation; it's neither a reward nor a recognition. You can put any golden tag on it, but it's about roles and responsibilities in the end. Every company has specific HR, accounting, sales, or IT duties. These responsibilities need to be filled by people with particular roles. Like on any movie set, you have actors, directors, make-up artists, screenwriters, costume designers, etc., and it's the fulfillment of every single role that makes a great outcome.
* The second reason is that every company has a different understanding and interpretation of a role. I have seen companies that defined the CTO role strategically, separating all operational responsibilities like infrastructure and software engineering from it, with only architects and designers left. On the other hand, especially in startups, a CTO can be a hands-on engineer, hiring developers, negotiating MS Office contracts, ordering printers, and building a production infrastructure. While my personal interpretation leans towards the first, company size, time to market, and financial limitations may require a CTO of the latter. I have learned that it's the most important thing to me to stick to my beliefs which reduces the number of potential employers that agree with my view of the role.
* The third reason is the impact of the role. I still want to change the world. That is why I became involved in technology. If I see the chance to have a fundamental impact on an industry or people's life, I will take it. We have the luxury of earning money with something we'd be doing anyway. We know how to build software, organize work, and run a product on infrastructure. We should use that knowledge whenever we can to do good.

I am taking on a role that seems "beneath" me for the aforementioned reasons. Also, it's a review of my professional career so far. What have I learned in the past years? Can I align organizational change with technology more successfully when focussing on one part of it instead of the whole picture? 
From experience, we know that focussing on one thing will make this thing happen - with the price of other things not happening. This is also known as prioritization. Whenever you're struggling with your workload, think of prioritization as a tool for structure. So I am applying that to my professional life while still being able to look at myself in the mirror every morning. To make a step forward.
